# Variadic Functions

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of variadic functions in C. Specifically, it implements a function to sum a variable number of integers.

## Files

- `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and include guards.
- `0-sum_them_all.c`: Implementation of the `sum_them_all` function.
- `test.c`: A test file to check the functionality of `sum_them_all`.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Compilation

To compile the code, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 test.c 0-sum_them_all.c -o a
